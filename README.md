# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction using IMDb Data

This project explores and predicts IMDb movie ratings using data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning models in Python. The dataset includes details about Indian movies such as duration, genre, directors, actors, and viewer votes.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Understand data patterns and relationships that influence movie ratings.
- Clean and preprocess real-world messy data.
- Engineer useful features from text-based columns.
- Visualize key insights using various plots and statistical summaries.
- Train machine learning regression models to estimate movie ratings.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **pandas**, **NumPy** – for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **scikit-learn** – for building and evaluating regression models  

## 📈 Key Techniques Applied

- Data cleaning and handling of missing values
- Feature extraction (from strings like "Duration", "Votes", "Year")
- Categorical encoding for genres, actors, and directors
- Outlier detection and removal using the IQR method
- Data visualization (bar plots, box plots, line plots, histograms)
- Model training: Linear Regression & Decision Tree Regressor
- Evaluation using R² Score and RMSE

## 📊 Results

The project demonstrates how different features impact movie ratings and builds models that can predict ratings based on those features.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure the IMDb dataset is available locally (or modify the code to point to your dataset).
3. Run the notebook or script using Jupyter or any Python environment.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is assumed to be `IMDb_Movies_India.csv`. Make sure to update the path as needed.
